class PNMCompactor(DmaDevice):
    """
    Processing Near Memory compaction offload engine (hardware accelerator).

    The guest writes byte counts to MMIO registers and issues CMD_SUBMIT.
    The device models compaction latency as timed delays based on the
    configured bandwidth.  If use_dma is True, a 16-byte CompactionResult is
    written to dma_addr via physProxy at job completion.  Real DRAM pressure
    comes from the pnm_compaction_unit process running on core 1.

    Completion fires after all bandwidth delays plus process_latency overhead
    (models fixed compute time in the PNM ASIC).

    MMIO register map: see pnm_compactor.hh.

    Guest submission sequence:
      write CMD=2 (reset)
      write SRC_BYTES
      write DST_BYTES
      write CMD=1 (submit)
      poll STATUS until bit1 (done) or bit2 (error) is set

    pio_addr must fall within [0xC0000000, 0xFFFF0000) so the X86Board
    bridge forwards MMIO accesses from the CPU to the IO bus.
    dma_addr must point to a valid DRAM region not used by the guest OS.
